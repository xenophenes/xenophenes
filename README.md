# Hi, I'm Sarah Conway
I'm a jack-of-all-trades with 12+ years experience in the world of open source, living in San Bernardino, CA and capable of working remotely in any timezone.

💻 I'm passionate about all the amazing advantages open source communities have for furthering the world of tech. I've worked as a developer advocate, DevRel specialist, cloud / technology evangelist, product marketing manager, social media manager, senior software engineer, technical writer, diversity & inclusion chair, instructor, front-end developer, and a number of other roles throughout the years. Currently, I'm working as a consultant at my own company called Talk to Me About Tech.

👀 Robotics, cybersecurity, and the environment are all fascinating topics to me. Star Wars & Monty Python also have hefty influence in my world of interests.

🎻 An interesting side note about me - I've been playing violin for 22 years, & viola for 10! (Yes, I do offer remote teaching sessions.)

**Looking for some additional challenges and fun projects!**

💞️ Would love to collaborate on a variety of different projects, including:

✅ those needing a developer advocate to craft marketing strategy, handle social media outreach, build communities across different platforms, and manage & create content.

✅ those needing a technical writer or documentation expert who can adequately translate product functionality into a complete documentation environment, no matter the existing state of your docs.

✅ those needing a frontend developer who can cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript / JQuery, CMS implementation, JAMStack, Hugo, HubSpot, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Wordpress. 
    
📄 I can work independently or as a team player in any time zone, and can implement mockups, improve existing designs, or create my own implementations of content. All code has a minimal footprint, is well documented and tested, and results in responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect presentations of your content.

⛰️ I'm not bothered by challenges. If it's not on my resume, I'm able to apply the logic of other frameworks I've used over the years to pick up that technology with best practices and efficient implementations.

💬 I have a ton of experience around event organization, social media management, technical writing, leadership, diversity programs, adult education, public speaking, and customer satisfaction. If you think I can be of help as a tech or team lead, a coach, or a consultant, I'm happy to learn more about your needs.

Reach out anytime for help with connections, job searches, or assistance in getting started in open source or technology.
